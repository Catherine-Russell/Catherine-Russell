# About Me:
I am a passionate and motivated professional, excited to bring the skills I have gained from teaching to frontend and backend software development. <br>
Two things first got me interested in coding: creating interactive teaching resources and watching my software-engineer brother bring his projects to life. I further developed a passion for problem-solving and combining creativity with logic through online resources and Codewars puzzles. <br>
I have loved the challenge of a 16-week intensive bootcamp and am committed to pursuing a career in software engineering. I am dedicated to continuous learning and now seek an opportunity where I can make a strong contribution and develop my skills further.

## Key skills:
- **Fast learner** - learnt Python, JavaScript, React, Git, SQL/no-SQL databases in 16 weeks
- **Key engineering practices** - Agile framework, Test-Driven Development, pair programming, Object-oriented programming
- **Strong leadership, communication and interpersonal skills** - maintained excellent relationships as team member and subject lead
- **Multilingual** - Japanese and Spanish, with experience working abroad
